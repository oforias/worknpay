# WorkNPay - Executive Summary

## Company Overview
WorkNPay is Ghana's first comprehensive service marketplace connecting verified skilled workers with customers through a mobile-first platform with integrated escrow payments. We're transforming Ghana's $15 billion informal economy by providing trust, transparency, and secure transactions.

## The Problem
Ghana's 11 million informal sector workers (86% of employment) lack access to digital customers, while urban consumers struggle to find reliable service providers.
